I am **Christopher McKay**. I'm a full-stack and mobile software engineer. I've worked in the industry since 1998 and received a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2003. I also own and operate [Lakeridge Software](http://www.lakeridgesoftware.com).

I got my start as software engineer in the 80s where I taught myself how to write video games for the Apple ][e and TI-99/4A. I found a love for building things and discovering how things work. Every now and then, you can find me repairing small electronics, fixing my kids' toys or making repairs around the house and with my family's cars.

My greatest roles outside of the tech sector are as a husband and father. I love spending time with my family, whether it's attending my daughters' dance, cheer and drill performances or playing video games and baseball with my son.

I love being outside. I like to pretend I'm an avid mountain biker, but really mostly just ride around the city. Yellowstone is a favorite yearly destination for my and my family.

## üèÜ Achievements

-   I worked as the sole developer for [Insight Software Solutions](https://wintools.com) from November 1999 to May 2011. During that time, I developed their Windows desktop software suite sold by the company and learned business management.

-   In 2004, I opened [Lakeridge Software](http://www.lakeridgesoftware.com) where I developed mobile and desktop software. It's been on hiatus as I had several major life events which took me away from it for a while.

-   From May 2011 to present, I have been employed at [MasterControl](https://mastercontrol.com). Here I help develop the main software suite, both front-end and back-end. We mainly use Angular, React, ColdFusion and Java.
